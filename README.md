# country-app

This is a new project which I tried to reinforce my knowledge about how to fetch data and use it from APIs. 
I used a simple card structure to project the data to DOM and you can find information about 250 countries
(e.g. capital, official language, currency and coordinates of the selected country)

You can see the page here :  https://hmzaygn.github.io/country-app/
